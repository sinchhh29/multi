MULTIPLE DISEASE PREDICTION



DESCRIPTION:
Developed a multi-disease prediction system capable of diagnosing heart disease, brain tumors, and diabetes from user inputs and medical data. The model uses machine learning algorithm to achieve high accuracy and early detection. It eliminates the need to use separate systems for each disease, improving efficiency and aiding timely medical intervention. Achieved accuracies of up to 98% using algorithms like SVM, CNN, and Random Forest, with results deployed through a Flask-based web interface.
